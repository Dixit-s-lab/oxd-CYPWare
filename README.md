# oxd-CYPWare
This repository contains a script for automating MD simulations for CYP450-ligand complexes in the oxidized state
this is a modified script of the modified script of CYPWare 1.0.
please cite if you are using the oxd-CYPWARE script for the MD simulations.

The scriipt requires similar dependencies as CYPWare 1.0, once all the dependiencies installed proceed with further steps. 
The protein file, docked ligand poses are required by oxd-CYPWARE script to run the MD simulations.
The parameter fle should contain the name of the protein, name of the ligand,(in same folder) path to save the new MD files.
